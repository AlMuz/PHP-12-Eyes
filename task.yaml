News Site:
    Index: Show Categories list and 5 last news by creation date
    Categories: Display list of all categories, display category with related news by id
    Task: Show list of all news, Show article by id with commets
    Comments: Allow to create comment to news
    Page: Static Page Controller â€“ showing static pages (about us, contact form, 1 simple page)

Stuff we can improve:
    StaticPageController: We can put all the static pages (about us, contact us) in one controller since there is only template and nothing else.
    CategoryRepo: We can move getCategoriesNews function to NewsRepository since it fetches data from news table in database.
    Database name: We should make our local database names the same so we don't have to change it every time in Application.
